# Day 1 - 17th June
Time spent: 2 Hours <br>
Researched RP2040 Hardware documentation and the Pico Datasheets for reference. Began laying out the schematic on KiCad.

# Day 2 - 18th June
Time spent: 1 Hour <br>
Completed the Powerchain and QSPI Flash chip. Did a bit of digging on the footprint for the Abracon 12MHz crystal.

# Day 3 - 19th June
Time spent: 2 Hours <br>
Took a printout of the original pico 1 to compare my designs, also added the crystals and GPIO headers!

# Day 4 - 20th June
Time spent: 2 Hours <br>
Finished up the schematic and made it look pretty! Set up footprints and added the components to the PCB. Also fixed some values in the capacitors.

Neet to take some measurements before I can actually start tracing.

# Day 5 - 21st June
Time spent: 4 Hours <br>
Experimented with a lot of routing methods and component placements. Fixed footprints to smaller version (5050 LED -> 2020 LED, smaller caps, etc.).
Researched on a lot of electrical requirements to make a ground plane work.

# Day 6 - 22nd June
Time spent: 5 Hours <br>
Cotinued difference combinations of routing and component placements. However, a power spike caused me to lose the progress over the days. Rerouted and replaced all components and prepared for fabrication. Started designing silkscreen art!
